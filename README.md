# Steganography Data Security Project
This project integrates steganography and cryptography techniques to securely hide sensitive data within digital images, audio, and video files.

Converts secret information into encrypted text, then embeds it into cover images using a threshold-based method.
Utilizes key-based encryption to protect data, ensuring confidentiality and preventing detection.
Demonstrates an innovative approach to secure communication by combining steganographic and cryptographic methods for data protection.
